# Xplorer

A file explorer with character.

## Build information

This application is intended to be compatible with Windows and Linux.
You should be able to compile the code on both OSes without modifying the code.

|Framework|Compiler
|---|---|
|Qt 6.2.0|MinGW 64-bit

## Documentation

I am also using Doxygen and Graphviz for documentation, so there will be quite a lot of comments in the code.

## Icons

The icons used in the application are made by [Dave Gandy](https://www.flaticon.com/autores/dave-gandy) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com).
